Project Requirements
1. Functions:
○ Organize the program using functions to keep the code clean,
modular, and reusable.
○ Functions should handle specific tasks such as adding a movie,
removing a movie, and displaying the list of movies. 2. UserInput:
○ Allow the user to input their favorite movies and interact with the program by adding, removing, and viewing movies.
○ Use the input() function to gather data and guide the flow of the program based on user responses.
3. DataManagement:
○ Use a dictionary to store movie information, with movie titles as the
keys and their details (e.g., genre, rating) as the values. 4. Conditionals:
○ Implement if statements to handle different operations based on the user’s input, such as adding, viewing, or removing movies.
